This application makes use of the core JS/CSS/HTML code found in the [web repo](https://github.com/standardnotes/web). For issues related to the actual app experience, please post issues in the web repo.

## Running Locally

Make sure [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) is installed on your system.

```bash
yarn setup
yarn build:web # Or `yarn dev:web`
yarn dev

# In another terminal
yarn start
```

We use [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to validate commit messages.
Before making a pull request, make sure to check the output of the following commands:

```bash
yarn lint
yarn test # Make sure to start `yarn dev` before running the tests, and quit any running Standard Notes applications so they don't conflict.
```

Pull requests should target the `develop` branch.

### Installing dependencies

To determine where to install a dependency:

- If it is only required for building, install it in `package.json`'s `devDependencies`
- If it is required at runtime but can be packaged by webpack, install it in `package.json`'s `dependencies`.
- If it must be distributed as a node module (not packaged by webpack), install it in `app/package.json`'s `dependencies`
  - Also make sure to declare it as an external commonjs dependency in `webpack.common.js`.

## Building

Build for all platforms:

- `yarn build:all`

or

- `yarn build appimage`
- `yarn build mac`
- `yarn build snap`
- `yarn build windows`

## Installation

On Linux, download the latest AppImage from the [Releases](https://github.com/standardnotes/desktop/releases/latest) page, and give it executable permission:

`chmod u+x standard-notes*.AppImage`
